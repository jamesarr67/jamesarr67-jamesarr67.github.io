Well, I’m a person just like you, who is also interested in learrning to code and I’ve decided to try to learn python this time. Yes, this time, because I’ve tried to get going with coding MANY times over the last 20 years, but I’ve always (fairly quickly) hit a point where I felt I just wasn’t getting it. So, let’s keep our fingers crossed (when we’re not typing) and give it another go, together.</p>\n<p>First, I want to say that my goal isn’t to become a full-time coder.
